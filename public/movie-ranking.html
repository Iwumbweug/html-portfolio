<h3>The last ship</h3> <br />
<p> The movie highlights the role of the US<br />Navy in the fight against a pandemic that had attacked the world.<br /> Their role in getting the vaccine saving millions of people is worhty to watch.</p>
<br />
<h3>White house Down</h3>
<P>The movie is an series of events that unfold when within the <br /> President's close protection is a mole which puts the first family. <br />At risk and therefore some trustworthy men must use their expertise to secure the president and his family
    <h3>Salt</h3>
    <p>I just love it when Angellina Jollie gives us the whole experience<br />Of a Russian spy on mission in America.</p>
